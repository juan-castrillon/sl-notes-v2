Regular files Directories Special files The command:
file &amp;lt;file&amp;gt;can be used to determine the type of a file
Special files Under &amp;ldquo;special&amp;rdquo;, linux understands all files that are not regular. They are:
Character files These files, usually located in the /dev directory, represent devices that interact serially with the operating system (e.g., a mouse or keyboard).
Block files These are also normally located in /dev but represent block devices (devices that read and write data in fixed-size blocks, such as hard disks and RAM )</description></item><item><title>Filesystems</title><link>https://slnotes.blog.castrillon.ch/linux/system/files/filesystems/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2023 11:41:41 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://slnotes.blog.castrillon.ch/linux/system/files/filesystems/</guid><description>What is it?

The file system determines the structure and organization of the files, as well as the methods used to access and modify them.</description></item><item><title>Filesystem Architecture</title><link>https://slnotes.blog.castrillon.ch/linux/system/files/filesystem-architecture/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2023 11:37:25 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://slnotes.blog.castrillon.ch/linux/system/files/filesystem-architecture/</guid><description>The Linux file system structure is organized into a tree-like hierarchy, starting from the root directory /. The root directory contains several standard subdirectories, each serving a specific purpose.
Good to know Similar information can be found using man hier
Here is a list of the standard folders in the Linux filesystem hierarchy:
/bin - Binary executables for system &amp;amp; users. This directory contains essential command line utilities, such as ls, cat, and cp, that are required for basic system operation and are accessible by both the system and users.</description></item></channel></rss>
