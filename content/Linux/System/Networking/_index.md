In computer systems, a network is a group of devices (also known as nodes) connected together. Nodes in a network can communicate and exchange information with each others

Every device on a network must have a unique address, called an IP address, which is used to send and receive data.

There are two primary types of IP addresses:

- **IPv4** (e.g. `192.168.0.1`) — 32-bit addresses, widely used but limited in quantity. They are composed by 4 octets (8 bits)
- **IPv6** (e.g. `2001:db8::1`) — 128-bit addresses, designed to replace IPv4.

Networks are also made up of interfaces, switches, routers, and other components that work together to ensure data moves from one point to another.
