Linux is an open source operating system (OS). An operating system is the software that directly manages a systemâ€™s hardware and resources, like CPU, memory, and storage. The OS sits between applications and hardware and makes the connections between all of your software and the physical resources that do the work.

In particular Linux provides the kernel, on top of which all different OS (Distributions) are built. The linux kernel acts like a "glue" between software and hardware, allowing the applications to talk to the underlying physical devices. 

Files are stored in a hierarchical filesystem, with the top node of the system being the root or simply "/". Whenever possible, Linux makes its components available via files or objects that look like files. Processes, devices, and network sockets are all represented by file-like objects and can often be worked with using the same utilities used for regular files. 

Linux is a fully multitasking (i.e., multiple threads of execution are performed simultaneously), multiuser operating system with built-in networking and service processes known as daemons in the UNIX world.
