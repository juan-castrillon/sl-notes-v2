Virtual terminals
One virtual terminal (usually VT 1 or VT 7) is reserved for the graphical environment, and text logins are enabled on the unused VTs. 
To switch between VTs, press CTRL-ALT-function key for the VT. For example, press CTRL-ALT-F6 for VT 6. Actually, you only have to press the ALT-F6 key combination if you are in a VT and want to switch to another VT.
