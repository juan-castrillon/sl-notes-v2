The Go teams offers the [go playground](https://go.dev/play/). This is a web code editor and compiler that allows to write and run go code. 


The Go Playground has several features that make it a useful tool:

- Easy to use: The Playground has a simple interface that makes it easy to write and test out code.

- Interactive: The Playground allows you to write code and see the results in real-time, making it a great tool for learning and experimenting with Go.
 
- Shareable: You can share your code snippets with others by sharing the URL of the Playground page. This makes it easy to collaborate with others and get feedback on your code.
 
- Code formatting: The Playground automatically formats your code as you type, making it easier to read and understand.
 
- Import support: You can import packages and libraries from the Go standard library or from third-party sources, allowing you to explore and experiment with a wide range of Go code.
