# Welcome!

![Welcome](/images/welcome.gif)

Welcome to my personal collection of notes and summaries on tech related topics! this is just a big cheat sheet where I store all the things that I learn in courses, certifications, on classes and on jobs in order for me to have easy access from anywhere. 

Here you will find a wealth of information on various tech subjects, including programming languages, DevOps Tools, cloud, software engineering, and more. I have organized my notes by topic and subject, making it easy for you (but most probably me) to find the information needed.

If you are someone that is not me, I hope you find my notes to be helpful and informative.


Thank you for visiting my site, and happy learning!
